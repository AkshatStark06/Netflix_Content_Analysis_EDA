# 🎬 Netflix Content Analysis – EDA & Power BI Dashboard

An end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Power BI dashboard project built on the Netflix content dataset to uncover trends in content type, genres, ratings, geography, and release patterns.

## 📌 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze Netflix’s content catalog to understand what type of content is produced, when it is released, who it targets, and how it is distributed globally.
The project combines Python-based EDA with an interactive Power BI dashboard to deliver both analytical depth and business-ready insights.

## 📂 Dataset

* Source: netflix_titles.csv

* Total Titles: 8,800+

* Content Types: Movies & TV Shows

* Time Range: 1925 – 2021

* Key Fields: Title, Type, Genre, Country, Release Year, Rating, Duration, Description

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* The EDA focuses on uncovering patterns and trends through:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing

* Handling missing values and inconsistent formats

* Time-series analysis of content additions

* Genre and rating distribution analysis

* Geographical analysis by country

* Text analysis on content descriptions

* Feature engineering (e.g., Content Age)

* Advanced visualizations for insights discovery

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
### 🔹 Overview Page

#### KPIs:

* Total Titles

* Movies vs TV Shows distribution

* Total Genres

* Total Ratings

* Content timeline (Start–End year)

* Content split between Movies and TV Shows

* Ratings distribution across titles

* Genre-wise distribution

* Release year trend analysis

## 🔹 Content & Geography Analysis

* Top countries producing Netflix content

* Comparison of Movies and TV Shows by country

* Global content distribution insights

## 📈 Key Insights

* Netflix’s catalog is movie-dominant (~70%), with TV shows forming the remaining share.

* Significant growth in content additions occurred between 2016 and 2019.

* Netflix follows a mixed content strategy, combining:

* New originals

* A large library of older licensed content

* The platform has a strong global footprint, led by:

* United States

* Family

* Love

* World

## 🚩 Problem Addressed

* Raw Netflix data does not clearly reveal:

* Content strategy trends

* Audience targeting patterns

* Genre and rating dominance

* Global production distribution

* This project transforms raw data into actionable insights through structured analysis and interactive visualization.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Power BI

* DAX

* Data Visualization

## ✅ Key Outcomes

* Clear understanding of Netflix’s content strategy

* Identification of growth periods and audience focus

* Business-ready dashboard for quick insights

* Strong portfolio project combining EDA + BI storytelling
