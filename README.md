# Netflix_Content_Analysis_EDA
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Netflix dataset (netflix_titles.csv) to understand trends in content production, popular genres, content ratings, and the distribution of movies and TV shows on the platform. The analysis involves data cleaning, time-series analysis, text data manipulation, geographical analysis, feature engineering (e.g., 'content age'), and advanced visualizations.

Key Insights:

* Netflix's library is predominantly movies (~70%), with significant content additions between 2016-2019.
* The platform employs a mixed content strategy, balancing new originals with a deep library of licensed older content.
* The content catalog has a strong global presence, with the United States and India as major content producers.
* Content is largely targeted at mature audiences, with TV-MA and TV-14 being the most common ratings.
* Most movies are 90-120 minutes long, while TV shows often consist of only one season.
* Common themes in content descriptions include 'life', 'family', 'love', and 'world'.
